# rclone filter file to copy over spyking-circus cluster and spike files 
# Example usage:
#	>> rclone copy --filter-from circus_filt.txt (local_drive_name):/path_to_recording_session/spyking_circus...
#		 (team_drive_name):/path_to_recording_session/spyking_circus/ -P
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: This assumes you have all your clustering files in a folder called "spyking_circus". If not
# make sure to adjust the folder name below. Also, if you aren't holding you .prb file in the recording folder
# then make sure to copy it over there before you use rclone!

# include spyking_circus folder

+ spyking_circus/**.npy
+ spyking_circus/**.hdf5
+ spyking_circus/**.GUI
+ spyking_circus/**.prb
